# `Final`

## 1. Beginning
My final website is going to have an index page which will link to a gallery of some jewelry I have made, a contact page, and a page about me and my jewelry design. This is a basic idea, and it may change as I create the site. I may add more pages, but I am not sure yet. I may also add links with my previous web pages I created for this class. I would like to have my gallery page incorporate parallax scrolling, so it will be a little different than the other pages. I am using my own pictures for my jewelry and logo. I don't have a great camera, so hopefully it turns out OK.

Color Scheme: Purple, Orange, Black, Grey

## 2. Summary
* I decided to make my final website about my jewelry design because it is one of my passions.
* I created the files and folders.
* I took pictures of all my jewelry for the site and logo and edited them.
* I created my navigation bar and header for the site first.
* Then I worked on my contact page and gallery.
* I ended up using the parallax scrolling technique on my `about` page instead of the `gallery`.
* I created the form for the contact page by using the techniques we learned during the class.
* I decided to use quotes on my index page because I had all this blank space and felt like I already incorporated the important things on the other pages.

## 4. Trials and Triumphs
* I struggled getting parallax scrolling to work again, but I figured it out by tweaking my code from the parallax assignment.
* It took me a whole day to get my gallery set up correctly. I had so many pictures it took a lot longer than expected.
* I am still struggling with using responsive web design throughout the whole site. I did incorporate it on the `about` page.
* I learned how to style the forms a little bit more with fieldset backgrounds and rounded boxes.
* I noticed that sometimes it takes a little bit to load the pictures.

## 5. Conclusions
* I feel like overall my site is pretty good, and I like what I have created.
* I think that if I had more time, I would work on RWD more for all the pages.
* I feel like I incorporated as much as I could in the time-frame given while also working on my other finals.
* I would also try to work on making the gallery images maybe load faster and have them all be the same size. I struggled a little bit trying to make them similar sizes. I took the photos with an iPhone and had to crop them. They all ended up different sizes and it was just kind of messy. If I had a camera it may have worked out better.
