My final website is going to have an index page which will link to a gallery of some jewelry I have made, a contact page, and a page about me and my jewelry design. This is a basic idea, and it may change as I create the site. I may add more pages, but I am not sure yet. I may also add links with my previous web pages I created for this class.
